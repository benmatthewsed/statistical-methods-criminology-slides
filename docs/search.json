The default for clarify is 1000 draws.\nMore simulations are always better, but will take longer - so there is a pragmatic aspect to how much time and computer resource you have to run simulations.\nIn general I would recommend using a package like clarify if you conduct this kind of simulation.

This is not (just?) an indicator of individual punishment histories, but reflects the chronic and long-term exposure to loss due to imprisonment in different neighbourhoods. This highlights the effects of imprisonment on the communities in which people who end up in prison lived prior to their imprisonment, rather than just focusing on the people who are currently in prison."

This is useful as a way to understand the method, but whilst it‚Äôs good to know how this works, in practice there are R packages which can do this for us.\nOne good option is clarify, as used in the first example\nThere is inherent uncertainty in simulation results, so it‚Äôs crucial to set the seed for the random number generator so you get the same results every time.\nYou also need to run enough simulation draws to get a good estimate of the uncertainty. The default for clarify is 1000 draws.\nMore simulations are always better, but will take longer - so there is a pragmatic aspect to how much time and computer resource you have to run simulations.\nIn general I would recommend using a package like clarify if you conduct this kind of simulation. It‚Äôs likely that professionally developed and maintained software will be less error-prone and more efficient than writing your own!"

    "text": "Talking about residual confounding\n[ add screenshots ]\nProbably the biggest limitation of our study is that the IPTW modeling approach we adopted assumes no unmeasured covariates linked to both treatment and outcome. In practice, the criterion of having no unobserved confounding is impossible to verify‚Äîthe data in any observational study provide no definitive information (Robins, Hern√°n, and Brumback, 2000). As discussed above, however, we tried to counteract this limitation by exploiting what we believe are rich individual baseline data and timevarying covariates over the full life course in order to model the propensity to marriage. It is hard to imagine what the missing time-stable or time-invariant covariates are that would overcome the magnitude and robustness of results. From IQ to the cumulative history of both the outcome and the treatment, we accounted for 20 baseline covariates and approximately a dozen time-varying confounders measured from widely varying sources‚Äîmany of which predict the course of marriage as theoretically expected (table 1).\nWe thus argue that omitted confounders would have to be implausibly large to overturn the basic results obtained under a number of different model specifications and assumptions.22\n22 A formal sensitivity analysis (see Robins, 1999: 167‚Äì73) is beyond the scope of the current paper. Moreover, such analyses require assumptions about the magnitude, direction, and functional form of potential biases that ultimately raise more questions than they answer\n(https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-07491-001)"
