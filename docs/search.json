    "text": "Implications for analysis: Population or super-population?\n\nOne reason people use inferential statistical models is to generalize from the data they have to a wider population. With recorded crime data, is this the whole population?\noutline two possible approaches to conceptualizing police recorded crime data: a population or superpopulation approach [@verlaan2024use]\nPopulation approach: if you have police recorded crime data for Scotland in 2023 the data you have is all you could ever have. You don’t need to fit statistical models to generalize from the data you observe to a wider population because there is no wider population.\nSuperpopulation approach: you can think of Scotland in 2023 as ‘drawn’ from from the population of the UK, or Europe, or the whole planet. Alternatively, data from Scotland from 2023 may be seen as a sample from Scotland from 2023 and 2024, or 2023-2030 and so on. You might also want to construct a counterfactual of what crime would have been like in Scotland in 2023 if unemployment was 5% lower or 5% higher Gelman (2011)"

Weighting cannot adjust for populations who are excluded from the survey by design."
