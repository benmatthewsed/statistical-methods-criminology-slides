The default for clarify is 1000 draws.\nMore simulations are always better, but will take longer - so there is a pragmatic aspect to how much time and computer resource you have to run simulations.\nIn general I would recommend using a package like clarify if you conduct this kind of simulation.

This is not (just?) an indicator of individual punishment histories, but reflects the chronic and long-term exposure to loss due to imprisonment in different neighbourhoods. This highlights the effects of imprisonment on the communities in which people who end up in prison lived prior to their imprisonment, rather than just focusing on the people who are currently in prison."
