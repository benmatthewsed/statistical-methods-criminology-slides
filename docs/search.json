I have not seen these methods used in criminology very much - One informal approach to unmeasured confounding is to claim that your measures are good enough to make it not a problem\n\nbecause we do not see U, we must impute its values using probabilities (bets) about the values of U given what we do see (again, X and Y ).\n\nThe tipr approach is to unmeasured confounding - not just that we have a variable measured inaccurately, but that there is a key variable we haven‚Äôt measured, although Peto suggests that these in practice are hard to distinguish\nneed some criminological examples here\nProbably the biggest limitation of our study is that the IPTW modeling approach we adopted assumes no unmeasured covariates linked to both treatment and outcome. In practice, the criterion of having no unobserved confounding is impossible to verify‚Äîthe data in any observational study provide no definitive information (Robins, Hern√°n, and Brumback, 2000). As discussed above, however, we tried to counteract this limitation by exploiting what we believe are rich individual baseline data and timevarying covariates over the full life course in order to model the propensity to marriage. It is hard to imagine what the missing time-stable or time-invariant covariates are that would overcome the magnitude and robustness of results. From IQ to the cumulative history of both the outcome and the treatment, we accounted for 20 baseline covariates and approximately a dozen time-varying confounders measured from widely varying sources‚Äîmany of which predict the course of marriage as theoretically expected (table 1).\nWe thus argue that omitted confounders would have to be implausibly large to overturn the basic results obtained under a number of different model specifications and assumptions.22\n22 A formal sensitivity analysis (see Robins, 1999: 167‚Äì73) is beyond the scope of the current paper. Moreover, such analyses require assumptions about the magnitude, direction, and functional form of potential biases that ultimately raise more questions than they answer\n(https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-07491-001)\n\nIt‚Äôs true that you have to make assumptions about the unmeasured confounding to know the impact on your results, and so it‚Äôs necessarily speculative\nBut this is possible!\n\n‚ÄúHowever, increasing the number of covariates is hardly a persuasive approach to ruling out potentially important confounders, as it is unlikely that one can adequately measure all such confounders‚Äù\n\nfrom their study they find:\n\n\n# from table 2 in Sampson, Laub and Wimer, p 491 \n# https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/sampson/files/2006_criminology_laubwimer_1.pdf\n\nlibrary(EValue)\n\nevalues.RR(est = 0.572, lo = 0.511, hi = 0.640)\n\n            point lower upper\nRR       0.572000 0.511  0.64\nE-values 2.891988    NA  2.50\n\n  bias_plot(0.572, xmax = 10)\n\n\nFrom this, the unmeasured confounder would have to be associated with an almost three-fold increase in the risk of offending, and must be almost three times more prevalent in those married than those not married, to explain the observed risk ratio.\nThe question then becomes‚Ä¶ how plausible is this?\nSee https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/EValue/vignettes/multiple-bias.html\nhttps://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-82673-4\n‚ÄúThe preceding approach assumes that U is a known confounder (e.g., a smoking indicator) that was unmeasured in the study in question but has been previously identified and subject to study in relation to disease if not exposure. If instead U represents an unspecified, unknown confounder, then the entire sensitivity exercise will remain far more speculative. Nonetheless, decomposition of the bias factor can still be successful in demonstrating that only implausibly strong confounder or selection effects can account for a strong observed association. Cornfield et al.¬†(1959) is considered a landmark study in which such an approach was used to examine claims that the smoking-lung cancer relation might be attributable to confounding‚Äù\n\nso this is based on the idea tat we can identify an ‚Äúimplausibly strong‚Äù confounder, which is reasonable.\nOne approach is to pick a bunch of possible bias parameters and test to see if results are robust to all of them."

This highlights the effects of imprisonment on the communities in which people who end up in prison lived prior to their imprisonment, rather than just focusing on the people who are currently in prison."
